CWH TUTORIAL 1 & 2 on 2nd may monday

npm create react app means you bought something permanently and your stroge space in your ssd is fatlu then do that 

instead use npx it will installed only when you want to use 

it is basically a library of js but many people use it as a framework as it gives a direct compititon to anglur and all 


what is component based architecture?
  ---> we can divide a webpage into components and its biggest advantage is that we can reuse it again and if we want to change any of one component then we can do change and render it again without changing the another 


  Node js use during run time . it is useful to start the website without using the web browser


  Now understand the folder structure 
   ---> whatever modules require it comes into node modules 

     ---> if you want to change the node modules then it can change with the help of package.json and 


      --->now there will be two folders only that is public and src . Whatever components we create then it is created into the src folder 
      and in that components contains props and states 

      what is props and states 
      ---> let a template is created and it consist of some fields and we can fill details in that form then only it is form and sending that form along with details that is props

      ---> let this is component and its heading is harry  
      ek component ke state ka matlab hai ki usme kya kya details hai 
          
          props means that whatever details send and change its condition

with the use of REACT we can use the API very easily and we dont have to write more js 

in index.js
     all the components comes into this 
     there is use of strictmode also and one should use it 


in app.js 
  whatever website i can see then the code of app.js is rendering 
    whatever create react app then on website the code of app.js . and we have to edit only app.js 
      
      there are two types of components one is funciton based and another is class based . But nowadays function based component are more used 
           in this whatever code is there then that is JSX (javascriptXML) . it is HTML only who wear JS mukut .


           htmlFor , tabIndex , className

           remember only one element/tag i have to return from any js file 
           to  use the number of tags or elements we use the jsx fregment
           what is jsx fregment?
           <></>
           and inside this you can add more tags   
           even i can add the components also with syntax like <Navbar/> a closing tag is imp here 
           and whatever we write into the {} curly braces then it will be work as a javascript   

      

How the website actually work in mutlipage web application 
   	---> Then whenever user come and sent the request to the server then in response HTML + CSS + JS will delivered of respective page like about ki html , css and js will be different then contact ki different aayegi likewise 

How the website actually work in a single page web application 
  	----> Then here just only single time user sent the request and only single time HTML , CSS and JS will be delivered and then from here JS will takeover and page will be responded with help of APIs, just only the data will change and not the css of header or footer , and data will come with the help of APIs 

                       with these method one can save llots of bandwidth as well as reduce the load on server and space too in users device 

		always remember that we never share the node modules folder as it can be installed by anyone from the internet and because of this reason only the modules fall down into gitignore folder . you can installed with command line "npm install"

Now its time to understand the props it means properties 
    ----> we can sent object or boolean and using that value components gets rendered itself . 

    try to use the ES7 react/redux it will provide shortcuts and very useful and saves a lots of time 

      Note : Please dont remove comments 
    namedexport and export default 

Props 
    ---> always write the name of components start with capital letter

    means we are giving something to my components and i will fill the info according my correspondence . and props can be sent from app.js . 
        --->props should be read only that is we cant change the props directly in the function and that props remeains as it is but the text can be change 

        types of props 
        Navbar propTypes = {
          title : propTypes.string,
          abouttext : propTypes.string,

        } try to use the react.org
        Navbar propTypes = {
          title : propTypes.string.isRequired,
          abouttext : propTypes.string,

        } 
        try to add the isRequired condition to most of props as it is good 

        Default prop use when if I forget to send the props then set this default props 

        Navbar.defaultProps ={
          title : "textutils"
          abouttext : "sdf"
        } it is the good practice to write the defaultProps

        Atlast props is nothing but just we are sending the value while calling the components or with the help of defaultProps and we can set the types of prop with help of propTypes

 
 CWH TUT 7&8 5th may Thurday

    Time to Understand the State (awastha use cheez ki )
          ek perticular time pe use cheez ki state kuch hoti hai . jese ki maine textform mai kuch likha to use wakt ki vo useki state ho gayi 

          useState used to create a state variable and with use of it we can change the existing state of anything i means user can change the existing state with this now 

          {useState} import it from react 
          const [text , setText] = useState("0"); // here we did inititalize the text and setText
          can change the text with setText 

          React Hooks 
              ----> we use {useState} is the hook
              first i import useState from react 
              we can use the features of class without createing the class 


$0 means is that element which one you have selected and it is use only when you are on chrome only

CWH TUT 11 6th may Friday

    Now we doing some improvment in dark mode is that we are hadling the dark mode from App.js only by sending the props to the Navbar.js
       for to do that you have to use the ``(i.e backticks) so that you can use the js in Navbar.js and do some changes

CWH TUT 12&13 7th may saturday

     All things is written in app.js 
      const [mode, setmode] = useState('light');
      const [switchText, setswitchText] = useState("Enable Dark Mode") // with this state i am changing the text part 
      const toggleMode = ()=>{
         if (mode === "light" && switchText ==="Enable Dark Mode") {
             // see mode and switchText is the state variable so whenever i use the toggleMode funciton then at that time both state variable   comes into the use 
             setmode("dark");
             setswitchText("Disable Dark Mode");
            document.body.style.backgroundColor="#091240";


        }
       else{
         setmode("light");
         setswitchText("Enable Dark Mode");
         document.body.style.backgroundColor="#091240";

    }
  }

    <Navbar title = "textutils" abouttext ="About Us" mode = {mode} toggleMode = {toggleMode} switchText = {switchText}/>
      
      This is written is Navbar.js 
          <div className={`form-check form-switch text-${props.mode ==="light"?"dark":"light"}`}> with use of this mode i am changing the color of switch part with use of ternary operator

              remember to add the background color then use the document.style.backgroundColor = "name of color"


Now its time to add the dismissial alert in the js with the use of alert.js components
    we are using the function based component for the alert 

    NOTE THAT 


    CWH TUT 16&17 9th may monday 
        React Router means things which will not change then i will not bring everytime from the server what it means ki if your Navbar is not changing or stay same in everypage then dont reload or bring from the server  . so that it will saves a lots of bandwidth and spaces also . 

          npm install react-router-dom 
          and it is wrap between router and things in switch 
          and use the exact path

      Github pages ans hosting 
        npm run-build
            it will create a build folder and make a static website for you . react create a optimized the app behind the scenes and ti will get by running it 
        npm run start 
            it will just give development server
